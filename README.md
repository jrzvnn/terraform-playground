# Terraform Playground

This repository serves as a compilation of my Terraform code examples and projects. Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Terraform, follow these steps to get started:

1. **Installation:** Make sure you have Terraform installed on your system. You can download it from the official Terraform website.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jrzvnn/terraform-playground.git
```

3. **Explore Examples:** Browse through the various folders in this repository to explore different Terraform examples and projects. Each folder contains a separate Terraform configuration.

4. **Set Up Provider Credentials:** For cloud provider examples, make sure to set up your credentials properly. You can usually do this by using environment variables or configuration files. Refer to the documentation of the respective cloud provider for guidance.

5. **Run Terraform Commands:** In each example folder, you'll find a main.tf file containing the Terraform configuration. Use commands like `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` to initialize, plan, and apply the configuration respectively.
   
Happy Terraforming!
